# Grower's corner
## Introduction
Hello, I intend this `github` repository as blog to share my experience with plant growing in block house conditions.
Recipes, articles, ideas, photo publication.

Here is link  to my (I hope updated) list/taxonomic tree 
[[github-interface](https://github.com/grunwmar/biology-plants/blob/main/plants.yaml)|[raw](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grunwmar/biology-plants/refs/heads/main/plants.yaml)] of plants I possess.


> **This should be list of articles I will write in the furure, maybe...**
